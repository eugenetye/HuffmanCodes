# Huffman Codes
This is a Python program that implements the Huffman Codes algorithm.

## Project Specification

A Huffman code uses different numbers of bits to encode the letters: more bits for rare letters, and fewer bits for common letters. The Huffman codes are determined using the English alphabet and frequencies provided below:

Huffman coding assigns codes to characters such that the length of the code depends on the relative frequency or weight of the corresponding character. Huffman codes are of variable-length, and prefix-free (no code is prefix of any other). Any prefix-free binary code can be visualized as a binary tree with the encoded characters stored at the leaves. This is called a Huffman tree, a full binary tree in which each leaf of the tree corresponds to a letter in the given alphabet. It is also the binary tree with weighted minimum path length, which is obtained by summing up the product of the length of each letterâ€™s frequency and the length of each code.
